# Simple-BlackJack-Game1

I will be working on this project by myself as a team of 1 person. In the game, the user will play again the dealer to try and reach the closest to the value of 21. The cards from the deck will be randomized The users inputs will allow them to “Hit” to continue receiving cards from the deck or they can “Stand” which allows them to play their current hand.
